# Configuration

Patchworks uses a configuration file named `.patchworks.json` at the root of your project to track information about your template repository.

## Default Configuration

When you create a new project with `patchworks create`, a configuration file is automatically created with contents similar to:

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "template": {
    "repository": "https://github.com/original/template",
    "branch": "main"
  },
  "commit": "abc123def456..."
}
```

This configuration:

- Tracks the Patchworks version used
- Specifies the template repository URL and branch
- Records the last synced commit hash

## Configuration Fields

| Field                 | Description                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `version`             | The version of Patchworks used to create the project   |
| `template.repository` | The URL of the template repository                     |
| `template.branch`     | The branch of the template repository to track         |
| `commit`              | The last commit hash that was synced from the template |

> **Note:** Additional configuration options for customizing the sync behavior are planned for future releases.
