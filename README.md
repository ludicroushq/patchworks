# Patchworks

Automatically sync your repository with updates from its template source.

## Problem

When you clone a template repository, you lose the connection to the original template. If the template author fixes a bug or makes an improvement, there's no easy way to pull those changes into your repository.

## Solution

Patchworks creates an automated system that tracks which template repository your project was based on and helps you stay updated with changes.
